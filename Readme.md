# Decc's Infinite Permadeath run counter

Made by [Yanrishatum](https://github.com/Yanrishatum) for Decc because I wanted to.  
This work was made under public domain with exception of used acces which are belong to their respective owners, refer to Asset sources section. Hence, you are free to fork and make version for DS1/DS2/DeS/BB/modify for your channel/whatever without any restrictions and credits.

## Basic usage
1. Host on your site/github.io page
2. Edit runs.txt according to format
3. That's it.

### URL specifics
* Adding `#completed` or `#finished` hash to the url will switch page to "Completed only" filter.
* Adding `#incomplete` or `#unfinished` hash to the url will switch page to "Incomplete only" filter.

### `runs.txt` format
* `#` at the beginning of the line considered a commentary and ignored.
* Each entry should be separated by line (duh).
* No typos in weapon names are allowed, but they are case-insensitive.
* Format should follow this structure:  
`<weapon name> (<NG cycle>) - <user name>`
* Adding `#d` right after user name will mark attempt as failed.
* NG cycle should be either `NG`, `NG+` or `NG+X` where X is NG cycle. `NG` should be uppercase.
* Spaces between weapon name and ng cycle are mandary as well as ` - ` with spaces and semicolons.
